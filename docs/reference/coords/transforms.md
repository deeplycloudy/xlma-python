Classes representing implemented coordinate transformations. All classes use the [Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth-centered,_Earth-fixed_coordinate_system) system as a common intermediary system, allowing for conversions between systems. ![Figure demonstrating Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Ecef_coordinates.svg)
